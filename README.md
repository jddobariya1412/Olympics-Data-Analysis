🚀 Olympics Data Analysis Project 🏅📊

Excited to share my latest project on Olympics Data Analysis (till 2016)! This project dives deep into four key aspects:

1️⃣ Medal Tally – Tracking medals across editions.
2️⃣ Overall Analysis – Trends, top-performing nations, and insights.
3️⃣ Country-wise Analysis – Performance of individual nations over time.
4️⃣ Athlete-wise Analysis – Standout athletes and their achievements.

With graphical representations and interactive visualizations, I developed a web app using PyCharm to showcase the data in an engaging way. 📈🎯

💡 Deployment Update: I have also hosted this analysis on a server using Render, making it accessible online! You can check out the project and source code on GitHub. 🔗

This project helped me enhance my data analysis, visualization, web development, and deployment skills. Looking forward to exploring more in this space! 🚀
