🚀 Olympics Data Analysis Project 🏅📊

Excited to share my latest project on Olympics Data Analysis (till 2016)! This project dives deep into four key aspects:

1️⃣ Medal Tally – Tracking medals across editions.

2️⃣ Overall Analysis – Trends, top-performing nations, and insights.

3️⃣ Country-wise Analysis – Performance of individual nations over time.

4️⃣ Athlete-wise Analysis – Standout athletes and their achievements.

With graphical representations and interactive visualizations, I developed a web app using PyCharm to showcase the data in an engaging way. 

💡 Deployment Update: I have also hosted this analysis on a server using Render, making it accessible online! You can check out the project and source code 

This project helped me enhance my data analysis, visualization, web development, and deployment skills. Looking forward to exploring more in this space!
